\section{Bottom $k$-sampling}

\paragraph{Exercise 2}
We want to prove the following:

\[
    E[|C \cap S^k_h(A)|/k] = |C|/|A|
\]

For each $x \in C$, the probablility $Pr[x \in S^k_h(A)]$ that $x$ is in the bottom-$k$ sample of $A$ is $\frac{k}{|A|}$. Thus, we expect $\frac{|C|k}{|A|}$ elements from $C$ to appear in $S^k_h(A)$, or in other words, $E[|C \cap S^k_h(A)|] = \frac{|C|k}{|A|}$. Divide by $k$, and we get $\frac{|C|}{|A|}$.
